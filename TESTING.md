# Testing

## TODO: Automated testing

At the moment, this extension does not have any automated tests. However, we
can still track manual test scripts.

## Manual Test: Save/Load Mailing

 1. Create a mailing
   1. Navigate to "Mailings => New Mailing" (`civicrm/a/#/mailing/new` or `civicrm/a/#/mailing/new/mosaico`)
   2. _Observe_: Redirect to `civicrm/a/#/mailing/123` and open with Mosaico layout
   3. Enter a mailing name. (Make a mental note of the name.)
   4. Under "Design", choose a template.
   5. _Observe_: A dialog opens with Mosaico.
   6. Create a block. Edit some text. (Make a mental note of the content.)
   7. Save.
 2. Immediately re-edit
   1. Under "Design", open the template again.
   2. _Observe_: A dialog opens with Mosaico. It restores the content from before.
   3. Save or close
 3. Try a full reload
   1. Navigate to "Mailings => Draft and Unscheduled"
   2. Find your mailing. Click "Continue".
   3. Under "Design", open the template again.
   4. _Observe_: A dialog opens with Mosaico. It restores the content from before.

## Manual Test: Tokens

This extension defines a TinyMCE plugin called "civicrmtoken".  To test this
plugin, create a mailing with a block of content. Then try each of the following:

 1. Edit a paragraph. In the toolbar, click the token dropdown and see a hotlist of 3-5 tokens. Pick one. Observe the new token in the paragraph.
 2. Edit a paragraph. In the toolbar, click the token icon and see a dialog. Pick one. Observe the new token in the paragraph.
 3. Edit a paragraph. Press Ctrl-Shift-T and see a dialog. Enter a filter and pick a token using the keyboard. Observe the new token in the paragraph.
 4. Edit a heading or button. Ensure that the the token icon/dropdown/hotkey work as expected. Observe the new token in the heading or button.
